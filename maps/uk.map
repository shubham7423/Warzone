; Ambiguities
; link between Angus and Fife? assume yes
; link between Argyllshire and Renfrew-shire? assume no due to botchy image editing to make it look like it doesn't
; link between Surrey and Buckinghamshire? assume yes zooming up close appears to show a link
; link between Essex/Hertfordshire and Kent? assume no since we don't have boats to paddle across the Thames
; Esses and Kent are now linked (we have bridges) -yura
; Some of the hyphenations can be removed from the territories i'm sure.

; Monmouth-shire (50) Somerset (54) assume yes
